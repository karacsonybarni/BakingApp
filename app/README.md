# Backing App

Baking App is an Android app 
that allows the users to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

## User interface

Baking App has three views:
* Recipes View, where all the recipes are shown
* The Details View shows all the ingredients and the steps to complete the selected recipe
* On the Step View the user can see the video and text instructions 
for the selected step in the recipe

### Recipes View

The Recipes View shows the names of all the recipes that the user can select. 
When the user selects a recipe by tapping on it, the app takes them to the Details View.

### Details View

In the Details View, the user can see all the ingredients of the selected recipe 
and also the titles of the steps for completing the recipe. 
The user can open the Step View by selecting one of these recipe steps.

### Step View

The Step View contains the video player view, the step description in text,
and the Previous/Next navigation buttons at the bottom of the view.
Not every step has a video, so the video player view is not always there.
Tapping on the Previous/Next buttons, 
the user can navigate to the previous and next steps of the recipe.
